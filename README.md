ALL AT ONCE
=================
**Yale School of Art**<br>
**Graphic Design MFA 2021 Thesis Show**

**On view April 22–28**

All at once—looking back, tripping forward, standing still. All at once—plugged in, displayed, replayed, looped. All at once—planes, edges corners. All at once—outwards, inwards, downwards, backwards. All at once—far away, close by, in motion. All at once—displaced, misplaced, replaced. All at once—everything, nothing, fleeting. All at once.

*All at Once* brings together the work of this year’s graphic design MFA graduating class through a unique merging of the physical and the virtual of our current environment. From April 22 to April 28, a continuously evolving live feed of work will be broadcasted 24/7 here at allatonce.space—while the physical show will be on view in person at Green Hall Gallery during regular hours.*
